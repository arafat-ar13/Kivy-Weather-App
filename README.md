## Upcoming features

* The app takes a few seconds (2-3s) to make the API calls to fetch weather data when the "Enter" button is pressed. This surely gives an impression that the app has frozen. To improve on this, a "Loading Screen" is currently in the works

* To make the app more fully-featured, a "Favorite Places" feature is also on the list of upcoming features. Users will be able to:
  * Add the current city that they are viewing to their favorites
  * Manage their favorites from the main screen
  * Access their favorite city weather with a click
  
* In the future, I plan to implement a system that'll show the weather data of tomorrow and the whole week.
